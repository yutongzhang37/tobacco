    "text": "1 Introduction\nWhile cigarette smoking stands as the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States, the issue of youth tobacco usage is of critical importance due to its profound role in fostering lifelong addiction. Early initiation escalates the risk of persisting tobacco habits into adulthood, particularly as adolescents exhibit heightened susceptibility to the addictive properties of nicotine. Consequently, understanding and addressing youth tobacco usage is crucial for not only enhancing the immediate well-being of young individuals but also shaping the future prevalence of smoking-related illnesses in the adult population.\nThis exploratory data report navigates through the extensive data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) Data, which offers insights into the pervasive issue of youth tobacco consumption. Our investigation centers on two primary inquiries. Firstly, we explore the incidence of tobacco (electronic cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars) usage among the youth population. Secondly, we scrutinize the frequency of smoking in youth. Through systematic analysis of variables, including state, year, gender, and education level, our objective is to identify disparities in patterns of tobacco exposure and addiction across these variables. For instance, we aim to discern whether youth tobacco exposure and addiction exhibit geographical variations and how gender and education level relate to these patterns. Moreover, a temporal analysis enables us to identify evolving trends in tobacco usage.\nIn summary, this report aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the CDC YTS dataset, intending to unravel trends and patterns in youth tobacco exposure and addiction. By examining various dimensions—geographic location, demographics, and temporal trends—we aspire to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing public health efforts focused on mitigating the impact of youth tobacco consumption."

    "text": "2.0.1 Technical description\nThe only dataset used for this project is the Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) Data, provided by the Office on Smoking and Health within the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The dataset can be directly accessed online at https://data.cdc.gov/Survey-Data/Youth-Tobacco-Survey-YTS-Data/4juz-x2tp.\nThe YTS Data is derived from the web-based National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), administered annually by CDC. The survey covers various aspects, including tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking cessation, school curriculum, minors’ access to tobacco products, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco, and exposure to pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media messages. A two-stage cluster sample design was employed to produce representative samples of students in middle schools (grades 6–8) and high schools (grades 9–12). The first stage involves selecting schools with probability proportional to their enrollment size, while the second stage randomly selects classes from the selected schools. All students in the chosen classes are eligible to participate in the survey, and a minimum overall response rate of 60% is required. NYTS has been conducted since 1999, and the YTS Data synthesizes the results from 1999 to 2017.\nYTS dataset is provided in a tabular format in CSV or Excel format and can be directly imported into R. The dataset was published on June 3, 2014, with the latest update on June 7, 2018. The metadata was last updated on August 25, 2023. It contains 10600 observations with 31 variables. We primarily focus on variables representing state, year, gender, education level, smoking status, type of tobacco used, and cessation efforts.\nWe also identified some potential issues with the data. First, there are some columns (TopicId, MeasuredId, StratificationID…) generated from the sampling process, which are irrelevant to the tobacco usage and cessation. Thus, these columns will be excluded in the analysis. Secondly, the dataset both gives the sample size of the youth who share the same smoking status under a given condition and the percentage of it among the total population. Considering the substantial variability in sample sizes based on different populations in schools and states, our emphasis will be on percentage values rather than sample size. Thirdly, in the gender column, the responses are female, male, and overall. Sample size of female and male do not exactly add up to the overall sample size, as other gender types are included. However,only binary genders (female and male) will be considered for comparisons, given the small sample sizes for non-binary genders. Additionally, due to missing data for certain states in specific years, temporal analysis may need to be conducted state-wise\n\n\n2.0.2 Research plan\nIn this section, we will first provide a brief introduction to our dependent and independent variables. We will then discuss the target values of interest that our data enables us to explore, followed by an examination of patterns that can be explored using demographic independent variables.\nOur primary dependent variable is “Data_Value”, representing the percentage of students who share the same smoking status among the entire student population with similar features. In other words, holding other features constant in an observation (Year, Location, education, and gender), “Data_Value” provides the percentage of students with the given smoking status, including type of tobacco, user status, and frequency response.\nRegarding independent variables, we have general demographic variables such as gender, education, states, and year of the survey. Additionally, we have variables related to smoking status, including the type of tobacco (smokeless cigarettes or not), user status (attempted/thought about quitting or not), and frequency response (how frequently one smokes).\nFor tobacco usage, we are interested in students’ exposure to tobacco products and their frequency of usage. To explore middle school and high school students’ exposure to tobacco, we will focus on the subset of observations where the Response variable is equal to “Ever.” According to the survey design, students who answered “Ever” reported having tried smoking cigarettes. We will also control for the TopicDesc variable to be either “Cigarette Use (Youth)” to examine student exposure to tobacco. The corresponding values in the “Data_Value” variable can then be interpreted as the percentage of students who reported ever trying smoking cigarettes.\nOn the other hand, controlling for other variables, we can also explore the tobacco addiction rate among the youth population. Instead of focusing on those who answered “Ever” to the Response variable, we will concentrate on those who reported “Frequent.” The corresponding values in the “Data_Value” variable for those who answered “Frequent” reported having smoked on 20 or more of the 30 days preceding the survey.\nWhile using smoking status-related dependent variables to explore tobacco exposure and addiction among the youth population, we will employ demographic independent variables such as States, Gender, Level of education, and year of the survey to investigate potential disparities in patterns of tobacco usage in the youth population. Specifically, we will:\n\nExplore youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates over time, examining variations in gender and education levels.\nInvestigate youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates across states, analyzing variations in gender and education levels.\nExamine the influence of gender and education on tobacco exposure and addiction rates within a specific state and year.”\n\n\n\n2.0.3 Missing Value Analysis\n\n\nCode\n# import dataset\nlibrary(readr)\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yutongzhang37/tobacco/main/Data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey__YTS__Data.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 10600 Columns: 31\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (24): LocationAbbr, LocationDesc, TopicType, TopicDesc, MeasureDesc, Dat...\ndbl  (7): YEAR, Data_Value, Data_Value_Std_Err, Low_Confidence_Limit, High_C...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nWe will remove variables with single unique observations and variables that are repetitive in nature.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# We now remove variables with single observation \ndata &lt;- Filter(function(x)(n_distinct(x)&gt;1), data)\n\n# use only the independent and dependent variable mentioned above\ndata_bf &lt;- subset(data, select = c(\"YEAR\", \"LocationAbbr\", \"TopicDesc\", \"MeasureDesc\", \"Response\",\"Data_Value\",\"Sample_Size\", \"Gender\", \"Education\"))\n\n# Number of missing values in different columns\ncolSums(is.na(data_bf)) %&gt;%\n  sort(decreasing = TRUE)\n\n\n    Response   Data_Value  Sample_Size         YEAR LocationAbbr    TopicDesc \n        2410          520          520            0            0            0 \n MeasureDesc       Gender    Education \n           0            0            0 \n\n\nOnly three variables contain missing values: Response, Data_Value, and Sample_Size. We now look for missing value patterns.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(mi)\nx&lt;- missing_data.frame(as.data.frame(data_bf))\n\n\nNOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern.\n Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables.\n     [,1]         [,2]         \n[1,] \"Data_Value\" \"Sample_Size\"\n\n\nCode\nimage(x,greyscale= FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom above graph, we can clearly see that Response, Data_value, Sample_Size are the only three variables with missing values. Data_Value and Sample_Size seem to have the same missing value pattern. In other words, when Sample_Size is missing, Data_Value is also missing, which is reasonable to observe.\nHowever, since we have a very large dataset, heapmap is the not the best to visualize the missing value patters. We will use plot_missing() function.\n\n\nCode\n# | fig-width: 30\n# | out-width: 100%\nlibrary(redav)\n\n# shorten variable name\ndata_bf &lt;- data_bf %&gt;% \n  rename(\n    State = LocationAbbr,\n    Topic = TopicDesc, \n    Measure = MeasureDesc, \n    Sample = Sample_Size, \n    Edu = Education,\n    Res = Response,\n    Value = Data_Value\n)\nplot_missing(data_bf, percent = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the upper marginal graph, it is evident that the variable “Response” contains a larger number of missing values. This occurrence is attributed to one of the “TopicDesc” values being set to “Cessation,” which aims to capture students’ willingness and attempts to quit tobacco usage. Consequently, the “Response” variable, which is utilized to record the frequency of tobacco usage, is left as missing in the dataset.\nFrom the main graph, we can confirm that Data_Value and Sample_Size share the same missing value pattern. In pattern 2, the sole missing value is observed in the “Response” variable, as mentioned earlier, due to its purpose in capturing tobacco cessation.\nIn pattern 3, all three variables—Response, Data_Value, and Sample_Size—are missing. Further investigation, referencing the code book and dataset, reveals that this situation arises from a very limited number of samples. This is predominantly the case when narrowing down the analysis to either females or males, coupled with the “TopicDesc” value set to “Cessation.”\nPattern 4, where only “Data_Value” and “Sample_Size” are missing, does not exhibit such occurrences. Verification can be conducted by the following:\n\n\nCode\ndata_bf |&gt; filter(Value == NA & Sample == NA & Res != NA)\n\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 9\n# ℹ 9 variables: YEAR &lt;dbl&gt;, State &lt;chr&gt;, Topic &lt;chr&gt;, Measure &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   Res &lt;chr&gt;, Value &lt;dbl&gt;, Sample &lt;dbl&gt;, Gender &lt;chr&gt;, Edu &lt;chr&gt;"

Subsequently, we will delve into a discussion on youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates, considering variations over time, across states, and differences in gender and education levels.\n\n3.0.1 Data Processing\nWe will continue to use variables mentioned previously.\n\nDependent variable:\n\nValue : the percentage of students who share the same smoking status among the entire student population with similar features\n\nIndependent variable:\n\nYEAR: Year of the observation\nState: Location of the observation\nTopic: Type of tobacco consumption(Cigarette/ Smokeless Tobacco/ Cessation)\nMeasure: Smoking Status (Smoking/ Quit Attemp)\nRes: Frequency of tobacco usage (Ever/ Current/ Frequent)\nSample: sample size\nEdu: Education background of the observation (Middle School/ High School)\nGender: Female/ Male/ Overall\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Impart Packages \nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(choroplethr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(vcd)\nlibrary(choroplethrMaps)\n# Import Dataset \ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yutongzhang37/tobacco/main/Data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey__YTS__Data.csv\")\n\n# We now remove variables with single observation\ndata &lt;- Filter(function(x)(n_distinct(x)&gt;1), data)\n\n# use only the independent and dependent variable mentioned previously\ndata_bf &lt;- subset(data, select = c(\"YEAR\", \"LocationDesc\", \"TopicDesc\", \"MeasureDesc\", \"Response\",\"Data_Value\",\"Sample_Size\", \"Gender\", \"Education\"))\n\n# Rename variables\ndata_bf &lt;- data_bf %&gt;%\n  rename(\n    State = LocationDesc,\n    Topic = TopicDesc,\n    Measure = MeasureDesc,\n    Sample = Sample_Size,\n    Edu = Education,\n    Res = Response,\n    Value = Data_Value\n)\n\n# order ordinal category\ndata_bf$Edu &lt;- factor(data_bf$Edu, levels = c(\"Middle School\", \"High School\"))\n\n\n\n\n3.0.2 How did patterns of youth tobacco exposure and addiction evolve from 1999 to 2017 ?\nTo address this question, we will initially examine the overall trends in youth tobacco exposure and addiction from 1999 to 2017. Subsequently, we will explore potential variations in these patterns based on gender and education levels. Our specific focus will be on the percentage of students who had ever smoked (youth tobacco exposure) and the percentage of students who had smoked frequently (youth tobacco addiction).\n\nOverall Trends in Youth Tobacco Exposure and Addiction\n\nTobacco Exposure\nTo assess trends in youth tobacco exposure rates, we analyzed the reported percentage of students who had smoked before each year. The accompanying boxplots demonstrate a clear decreasing trend in the percentage of youth tobacco exposure from 1999 to 2017. The median declined from approximately 50% in 1999 to below 20% in 2017, with consistently stable variance in data each year. The similar size of the boxplots across years suggests a consistent number of observations annually.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter dataset \ndata1 &lt;- data_bf %&gt;% filter( Topic == \"Cigarette Use (Youth)\" & Gender == \"Overall\" & Res == \"Ever\")\n\n# Treat Year as factors \ndata_y &lt;- data1\ndata_y$YEAR &lt;- factor(data_y$YEAR)\n\n# Plot Boxplot\nggplot(data_y, aes(YEAR, Value)) +\n  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE, fill = '#FFA07A') +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot: Percentage of Youth Tobacco Exposure from 1999 to 2017\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  xlab(\"Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Addiction\nSimilarly, to examine changes in the percentage of youth addicted to tobacco from 1999 to 2017, we focused on the reported percentage of students who smoked more than 20 days out of 30 before the survey. The accompanying boxplot indicates a decreasing trend in the percentage of youth tobacco addiction during this period. While the median of the youth tobacco addiction rate decreased from around 5% to approximately 1% from 1999 to 2017, the upper quartile decreased from roughly 15% to 5%. This observation suggests significant improvements have been noted in areas with historically high youth tobacco addiction rates over the past two decades.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# filter data\ndata2 &lt;- data_bf %&gt;% filter( Topic == \"Cigarette Use (Youth)\" & Gender == \"Overall\" & Res == \"Frequent\")\n\n# Treat Year as factors \ndata_y2 &lt;- data2\ndata_y2$YEAR &lt;- factor(data_y2$YEAR)\n\n# Plot Boxplot\nggplot(data_y2, aes(YEAR, Value)) +\n  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE, fill = '#FFA07A') +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot: Percentage of Youth Tobacco Addiction from 1999 to 2017\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  xlab(\"Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation of Trends in Genders\nWe are also interested in the evolution of youth tobacco exposure rate and addiction rate when considering gender.\n\nTobacco Exposure\nWe now grouped the data by year and gender to observe the reported tobacco exposure rates for different genders in different years. The graph below illustrates a clear decreasing trend for both female and male youth tobacco exposure rates from 1999 to 2017, confirming our earlier findings. Furthermore, the smooth line indicates a consistent gap between male and female youth tobacco exposure rates across years, suggesting that the male population consistently has relatively higher youth tobacco exposure rates.\n\n\n\nCode\n# filter data\ndata_ge &lt;- data_bf %&gt;% filter( Topic == \"Cigarette Use (Youth)\" & Gender != \"Overall\" & Res == \"Ever\")\n\nggplot(data_ge, aes(x = jitter(YEAR,1.2), y = Value, color = Gender)) +\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", span = .4, se = FALSE)+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1999,2017,1))+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Gender Difference in Youth Tobacco Exposure From 1999 to 2017\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Addiction\nAs in our previous analysis, we grouped the data by year and gender. The graph shows a decreasing trend in youth tobacco addiction rates for both genders across the years, consistent with our earlier findings. Notably, a consistent gap is observed between male and female tobacco addiction rates across all years, with the male population consistently exhibiting higher rates.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_gf &lt;- data_bf %&gt;% filter( Topic == \"Cigarette Use (Youth)\" & Gender != \"Overall\" & Res == \"Frequent\")\n\nggplot(data_gf, aes(x = jitter(YEAR,1.2), y = Value, color = Gender)) +\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", span = .4, se = FALSE)+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1999,2017,1))+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Gender Difference in Youth Tobacco Addiction From 1999 to 2017\")\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation of Trends by Education Level\nIn this section, we will examine youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates separately for middle school and high school across different years.\n\nTobacco Exposure\nWhile both middle school and high school youth tobacco exposure rates exhibit clear decreasing trends in the graph, high school students consistently demonstrate significantly higher tobacco exposure rates. The median high school tobacco exposure rate decreased from 70% to approximately 25% between 1999 and 2017, whereas the median middle school tobacco exposure rate decreased from around 45% to 10% during the same period. Throughout all years, high school students consistently maintain much higher median tobacco exposure rates. Additionally, the boxplots share a similar size, indicating a comparable number of observations in each year and education level.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_y1 &lt;- data1\ndata_y1$YEAR &lt;- factor(data_y1$YEAR)\nggplot(data_y1, aes(YEAR, Value, color = Edu)) +\n  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE) +\n  #facet_grid(Edu~.)+\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of Percentage of Youth Tobacco Exposure By Education Levels\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  xlab(\"Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Addiction\nIn exploring youth tobacco addiction rates, we observed decreasing trends in both education levels. High school students exhibited a median tobacco addiction rate of around 16% in 1999, which decreased to approximately 2.5% in 2017. In contrast, middle school displayed significantly lower youth tobacco addiction rates over the years, declining from around 4% to almost 0% during the same period. It is evident that high school consistently maintains much higher tobacco addiction rates than middle school across all years.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_y2 &lt;- data2\ndata_y2$YEAR &lt;- factor(data_y2$YEAR)\nggplot(data_y2, aes(YEAR, Value,color = Edu)) +\n  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE) +\n  #facet_grid(Edu~., scales = 'free_y')+\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of Percentage of Youth Tobacco Addiction By Education\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  xlab(\"Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering Both Genders and Education Levels\nBuilding upon our previous analysis, it became evident that both gender and education level influence youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates. In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the patterns across years, we have introduced controls for both gender and education. The dataset was segmented based on education levels and gender, allowing us to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the observed percentages of youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates.\n\nTobacco Exposure\nFaceting on years, we observe a clear declining trend in youth tobacco exposure from 1999 to 2017, confirming our previous findings. Additionally, a notable distinction emerges between middle school and high school average tobacco exposure rates, with middle school rates consistently around half of those in high school across all years. While gender differences in tobacco exposure rates are relatively minor, the graph indicates that males consistently exhibit higher youth tobacco exposure rates when controlling for year and educational levels.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_avegee &lt;- data_ge %&gt;% group_by(YEAR,Edu, Gender) %&gt;% summarise(ave_p = mean(Value), std = sd(Value))\n\nggplot(data_avegee, aes(x = Edu, y = ave_p, fill= Gender))+\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\")+\n  geom_errorbar(\n    aes(ymin = ave_p - std, ymax = ave_p + std),\n    position = position_dodge(.9),\n    width = .2\n  )+\n  facet_wrap(vars(YEAR))+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Youth Tobacco Exposure By Education Levels and Gender From 1999 to 2017\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Addiction\nYouth tobacco addiction rates also exhibit a distinct decreasing pattern across years, controlling for gender and education level. The disparity between middle school and high school addiction rates is striking, with the middle school average consistently remaining below 5% (from around 5% to almost 0%), while high school tobacco addiction rates dropped from around 17% to 2.5% from 1999 to 2017. Additionally, gender differences in tobacco addiction are noticeable in both middle school and high school across the years. However, compared to education level differences, gender differences are less prominent in tobacco addiction rates.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_avegef &lt;- data_gf %&gt;% group_by(YEAR,Edu, Gender) %&gt;% summarise(ave_p = mean(Value), std = sd(Value))\nggplot(data_avegef, aes(x = Edu, y = ave_p, fill= Gender))+\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\")+\n  geom_errorbar(\n    aes(ymin = ave_p - std, ymax = ave_p + std),\n    position = position_dodge(.9),\n    width = .2\n  )+\n  facet_wrap(vars(YEAR))+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Percentage\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Youth Tobacco Addiction By Education Levels and Gender From 1999 to 2017\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nYouth tobacco exposure and addiction rates both exhibited a significant decrease from 1999 to 2017.\nMale youth tobacco exposure and addiction rate is consistently higher than female youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates across all years\nHigh school students consistently maintained markedly higher tobacco exposure and addiction rates than middle school students over the past two decades, although as high school rates experienced a notable decline.\nControlling for both gender and education level, education level exerts a stronger impact on youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates than gender.\n\n\n\n\n3.0.3 How does youth tobacco exposure and addiction differ by states in 2017?\nTo address this question, we will initially examine youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates across states, controlling for education levels. Subsequently, we will explore gender and education level differences within each state. Only a subset of states has data in 2017 is included in this analysis.\n\nYouth Tobacco Exposure and Addiction Rates Across States By Education\nWe controlled for education levels to create a choropleth maps since the dataset contains varied observations across different levels of education. States lacking the relevant data are represented by the color black on the choropleth map. The deeper shade of blue indicates that this state has a higher percentage of youth tobacco exposure.\n\nTobacco Exposure\n\nMiddle School\nWest Virginia, Louisiana, and South Carolina exhibit a higher percentage of middle school youth who have previously engaged in smoking, with an approximate rate of 16%. Ohio reports the lowest rate of 8% for tobacco exposure in middle school youth.\n\n\nCode\n# filter data\ndata2017 &lt;- subset(data_bf, YEAR == 2017)\ndata2017 &lt;- data2017 |&gt;\n  mutate(State = tolower(State)) |&gt;\n  rename(region = State, value = Value)\nexposure &lt;- data2017 |&gt;\n  filter(Topic == \"Cigarette Use (Youth)\" & Res == \"Ever\") |&gt;\n  select(region, value, Gender, Edu)\nexposure_middle &lt;- exposure |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"Overall\" & Edu == \"Middle School\") |&gt;\n  select(region, value)\nexposure_high &lt;- exposure |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"Overall\" & Edu == \"High School\") |&gt;\n  select(region, value)\n\n# choropleth map\nsuppressWarnings({\n  state_choropleth(exposure_middle, num_colors = 1, title = \"2017 Middle School Youth Tabacco Exposure\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -104, y = 23, label = \"HI\", color = \"black\", size = 3) +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -116, y = 23, label = \"AK\", color = \"black\", size = 3)\n})\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh School\nConsistently, West Virginia, Louisiana, and South Carolina also exhibit higher percentage of tobacco exposure among high school youth, albeit with a notable increase to 35%. Connecticut has a comparatively lower percentage of 15% for tobacco exposure in high school youth.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressWarnings({\n  state_choropleth(exposure_high, num_colors = 1, title = \"2017 High School Youth Tabacco Exposure\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -104, y = 23, label = \"HI\", color = \"black\", size = 3) +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -116, y = 23, label = \"AK\", color = \"black\", size = 3)\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, the proximity of the highest percentage of middle school youth ever engaged in smoking to the lowest percentage among high school youth suggests a substantial number of youths experimenting with smoking upon entering high school.\n\nTobacco Addiction\nThe observed pattern of tobacco addiction closely aligns with the corresponding pattern of tobacco exposure.\n\nMiddle School\nLouisiana conspicuously exhibits the highest prevalence of youth who engage in frequent smoking, recording rates of 1% in middle school. On the other hand, Ohio demonstrate lowest proportion of youth addicted to tobacco in middle school, which is almost 0.1%.\n\n\nCode\n# filter data\nfrequent &lt;- data2017 |&gt;\n  filter(Topic == \"Cigarette Use (Youth)\" & Res == \"Frequent\") |&gt;\n  select(region, value, Gender, Edu)\nfrequent_middle &lt;- frequent |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"Overall\" & Edu == \"Middle School\") |&gt;\n  select(region, value)\nfrequent_high &lt;- frequent |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"Overall\" & Edu == \"High School\") |&gt;\n  select(region, value)\n# choropleth map\nsuppressWarnings({\n  state_choropleth(frequent_middle, num_colors = 1, title = \"2017 Middle School Youth Tobacco Addiction\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -104, y = 23, label = \"HI\", color = \"black\", size = 3) +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -116, y = 23, label = \"AK\", color = \"black\", size = 3)\n})\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh School\nAgain, Louisiana has the highest youth tobacco addiction rate among observed states, which is around 4%.

Consistent with previous findings, Louisiana, West Virginia, and South Carolina demonstrate higher rates of tobacco exposure across both educational levels and genders. Furthermore, across the majority of states, males exhibit a higher prevalence of tobacco exposure than females within both educational levels.\n\n\n\nCode\n# filter data\nexposure_g_middle &lt;- exposure |&gt;\n  filter(Gender != \"Overall\" & Edu == \"Middle School\")\nexposure_g_high &lt;- exposure |&gt;\n  filter(Gender != \"Overall\" & Edu == \"High School\")\n# Cleveland dot plots\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot(exposure_g_middle, aes(x = value, y = fct_reorder2(region, Gender=='Male', value, .desc=FALSE), color = Gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"2017 Middle School Youth Tobacco Exposure By Gender and Education\",\n       x = \"Percentage\",\n       y = \"State\") +\n  theme_minimal()\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(exposure_g_high, aes(x = value, y = fct_reorder2(region, Gender=='Male', value, .desc=FALSE), color = Gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"2017 High School Youth Tobacco Exposure By Gender and Education\",\n       x = \"Percentage\",\n       y = \"State\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n# combined two plots\nplot_grid(plot1, plot2, ncol = 1, align = \"vh\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Addiction\nThe plot revealed similar pattern with previous choropleth map, where the percentage of high school youth addicted to tobacco is higher.

High school male has the highest proportion of youth who had smoked, while middle school female has a lower proportion. We can also notice that there is more sample in middle school than high school and in female than male.\n\n\n\nCode\n# data pre-processing\nexposure_mosaic &lt;- data2017 |&gt;\n  filter(region == \"louisiana\" & Topic == \"Cigarette Use (Youth)\" & Res == \"Ever\" & Gender != \"Overall\")|&gt;\n  mutate(Exposure = ifelse(Res == \"Ever\", \"Had Smoked\", Res)) |&gt;\n  select(Gender, Edu, Exposure, value, Sample) |&gt;\n  mutate(Frequency = round(0.01 * value * Sample))\nnever_smoked_mosaic &lt;- exposure_mosaic |&gt;\n  mutate(Exposure = \"Never Smoked\",\n         Frequency = Sample - Frequency)\nexposure_mosaic_full &lt;- bind_rows(exposure_mosaic, never_smoked_mosaic) |&gt;\n  select(-value, -Sample) |&gt;\n  rename(Education_Level = Edu)\n# redefined variable order\nexposure_mosaic_full$Education_Level &lt;- factor(exposure_mosaic_full$Education_Level, levels = c(\"Middle School\", \"High School\"))\nexposure_mosaic_full$Exposure &lt;- factor(exposure_mosaic_full$Exposure, levels = c(\"Never Smoked\", \"Had Smoked\"))\nexposure_mosaic_cases &lt;-tidyr::uncount(base::as.data.frame(exposure_mosaic_full), Frequency)\n# mosaic plot\nvcd::mosaic(Exposure ~ Education_Level + Gender, \n            data = exposure_mosaic_cases, \n            direction = c(\"v\",\"v\",\"h\"),\n            main=\"Youth Tobacco Exposure of Louisiana in 2017\",\n            highlighting_fill = c(\"lightyellow\", '#FFA07A'), \n            gp_labels=(gpar(fontsize=9)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Addiction\nThe ratio of frequent smoker is very low for both genders in both education level, even if Louisiana has highest percentage of frequent smoker.

    "text": "5.0.1 Research Summary\nYouth tobacco exposure and addiction rates both exhibited a significant decrease from 1999 to 2017. Throughout this period, we consistently observed a persistent gap between male and female youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates. Furthermore, high school students consistently maintained markedly higher tobacco exposure and addiction rates than their middle school counterparts over the past two decades, even as high school rates experienced a notable decline.\nUpon controlling for both gender and education level, it becomes evident that education level exerts a stronger impact on youth tobacco exposure and addiction rates.\nFocused on the latest year data of 2017, we found that geographical disparities were evident, with Louisiana consistently standing out for its elevated rates of both tobacco exposure and addiction. Controlling for education levels revealed the evident pattern of increasing frequency in tobacco exposure and addiction, as youths transition from middle to high school, indicating a critical period for intervention. Gender differences persisted across states, with males consistently exhibiting higher rates of tobacco-related issues. In Louisiana, where the prevalence of tobacco usage is most pronounced, the observed pattern remains consistent.\nHowever, our study faced limitations due to data availability among different states and the lack of data dimensionality. Future research should include more observation across different years and states, as well as more factors that could be influential to tobacco consumption."
